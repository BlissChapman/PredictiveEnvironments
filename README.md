# PredictiveEnvironments
_Exploring how the underlying assumptions of predictive environments influence human systems._

In supervised machine learning, there is _often_ an underlying assumption that the data the model will encounter in the future (test set) is statistically similar to data encountered in the past (training set). When humans encode these beliefs in predictive environments that shape what news we read, what friends we interact with, what products we buy, ..., surprising outcomes can emerge.

The goal of this project is to answer:
- What are these suprising outcomes?
- Can we explore them in a lab?
- Can we simulate these effects with reinforcement learning agents? See: https://github.com/BlissChapman/WarGames
